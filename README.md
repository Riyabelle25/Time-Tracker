# Time-tracker App : Keep track of unfinished tasks and set deadlines.

I have implemented Form UI to upload new tasks and this data is being stored in FireStore. 

The task details are fetched from FireStore and then displayed in SliverList, in Cards.

CheckBox feature has been used to show tasks which are done.

Finally, Collapsible appbar has been used, for better UI effects :)
